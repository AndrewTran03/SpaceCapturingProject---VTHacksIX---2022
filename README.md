# Created during VTHacks2022

Project submitted to VT Hacks 2022

Team Members: Matthew Brenningmeyer, Vineet Marri, Abhay Raghavan, Andrew Tran

Created a chrome extention which displays a different picture of space each day, alongside the ability for users to mint their own NFTs of these pictures on minuturized and individualized blockchains. Due to the time constraints of the hackathon, the front-end was never fully linked to the back-end and remains in a demo state, however the program still retains full functionality when run from a configured client.
