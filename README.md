Allows users to get a new space image every day, and mint an NFT with it on a miniaturized, personalized blockchain. This project utilizes the APOD API from NASA to get a new picture every day, creates a unique hash for it through the IPFS standard, and mints it on a blockchain run through Hedera. This allows users to access the images much more freely through IPFS and allows for integration with platforms like Twitter and its NFT-based profile pictures. The project also contains a demo for a google chrome extension that would allow users to see this new image every day on the google.com homepage and mint it from their browser, streamlining the process.
